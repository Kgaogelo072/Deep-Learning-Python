Semantic segmentation is a machine learning technique where a digital image is labelled at the pixel level to
identifying and classify objects in a scene, such as road signs, pedestrians, and road markings in the context
of automotive vehicles, thereby enabling a computer to interpret the content in the image. Digital
images are created using devices such as digital cameras, scanners, or graphic design software. These devices
capture or create images by measuring the intensity and color of light at various points in the scene and
converting that information into digital data. The resulting digital file contains numerical values that
represent the color and intensity of each pixel in the image. The goal of semantic segmentation is to
group pixels according to the class/object they belong to from an input image. After an image is input
into a semantic segmentation algorithm, the algorithm should be able to delineate the different objects in
the image, as shown in Figure 1. segmentation is the foundation for tasks such as object detection and
scene understanding in autonomous vehicles and utilizes different algorithms, which rely on the texture and
color information to identify objects and regions of interest. Consequently, the performance of semantic
segmentation algorithms is affected by factors such as rain, snow, fog, and illumination. Semantic
segmentation algorithms are commonly evaluated based on two criteria: accuracy, that is, the success of the
algorithm in computing the segmentation task, and computation complexity, that is memory requirements
and speed. Overall, a good semantic segmentation algorithm should achieve high scores in both metrics. 
Changes in illumination can affect the accuracy and robustness of semantic segmentation algorithms,
as changes illumination alters texture and color of objects and regions. Therefore, the investigation
of the perception performance metrics of semantic segmentation algorithms under different illumination
conditions is necessary to assess the applicability of machine vision for autonomous-vehicle applications.
The architecture of a semantic segmentation network can have a significant impact on its performance. This
is because different architectures have different strengths and weaknesses and are optimized for different
types of tasks. Therefore, investigating the effect of semantic-segmentation-algorithm architecture on the
performance metrics is important for classifying semantic segmentation networks according to application
suitability.
